# Welcome to FICO

FICO-ITA is a multidisciplinary interest group in Computational Finance and Systematic
Investments operating within the ITA, in Brazil.
([FICO](https://fico-ita.github.io/en/fico/))

## Project

Project originated within the scope of course of Machine Learning in Finance, in the
Post Graduation Program of Operational Research, at Aeronautics Institute of Technology
(ITA), São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil. The project is a **Meta-Labeling Application**
for financial time series, with the purpose of predicting the direction of the next
price. This project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fico-ita/po_245_2023_T3)
repository.

## Documentation structure

This documentation has the purpose of presenting the understanding of the methods and
techniques used in the project, in addition of clarifying the decisions made during the
development of the solution.

The documentation was designed for the reader user of the solution. In addition,
considers the documentation for academic and software engineering purposes, i.e., with
the intention to allow the reader to develop the project.

The documentation is organized in 4 topcis, according to the type:

1. How-To guides
1. Example
3. API Reference
4. Developer Guide

The How-To guides topic is a documentation with a step-by-step guide to perform a
specific task.
On the Example topic, the reader will find a learning-oriented documentation,
with a practical application of the solution.
The API Reference topic is a documentation with a detailed description of the methods
and techniques used in the solution.
The Developer Guide topic is a documentation with a detailed description of the
solution, with the purpose of clarifying the decisions made during the development
of the solution.
